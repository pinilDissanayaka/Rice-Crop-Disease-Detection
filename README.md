## About Dataset

I found this dataset when it was not uploaded on Kaggle and was scattered across the internet. This dataset is a collection of multiple data sets I found online. The size of this dataset is ~ 7 GB due to the high resolution of images. The number of images in the dataset is
3355 .jpg files.

The dataset has been divided into two groups, train and validation.

Inside the two folders are 4 categories of types:

-BrownSpot
-Healthy
-Hispa
-LeafBlast
